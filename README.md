# README Comp177 Final Project (PFAM Explorer)

Team Members:
Matthew Carrington-Fair
Daniel Meyer

## Title: PFAM Explorer

This project was based off of Dan's research, so he contributed
a lot in accumulating the protein family dataset for our
visualization and formatting it appropriately for the 
framework and platform we used (d3/javascript, involving a lot of
JSON).
He also pioneered the work on implementing the network graph between
proteins using cytoscape js.

Matt focused more on setting up the scatterplot visualization
and using d3, along with setting up a Flask backend to host
our website and interact with many of Dan's python scripts for
serving the dataset.

Together we optimized our visualization, which included
refining the network graph for individual proteins and adding
connectivity between the two visualizations.
We also added final visual features and user interactions 
(slider to adjust thresholds for connected components).
